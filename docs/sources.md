Downloaded/verified October 29, 2026. Exact URLs, SHA-256 hashes, row counts and publisher notes are retained in data/sources.json and the generated manifest. These are complementary references from one official provider, not independent verification of sale terms.

The committed CSV is a normalized extract of all 2,373 scoped records, including subsequently excluded records. Source row means the original Excel row number, including workbook headings. Record ID hashes source ID plus row number. Original address/parcel/date/price fields allow a researcher to return to the original source.

This repository consumes the committed extract offline and verifies its SHA-256 and row count. Reacquisition/normalization is implemented in the companion Real-Estate-Motors-Marketplace-Analytics repository. To update this project, replace the extract and registry together after review; create a fresh database rather than silently overwriting audit history. Annual attributes and sale terms require independent verification.
